An American report from 2010 showed that child sexual abuse increased the risk of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress and suicide attempts.","\"Sexual abuse of children can lead to prolonged and lifelong health problems and increase the risk of suicide attempts and early death,\" says Siri Thoresen, a senior research at the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies. Thoresen studies the long-term effects of violence and sexual abuse.","There are myriads of websites where videos and images like these can be shared. Some of the websites log users and downloads and post them openly online. It was in these logs, containing details of over 36 million downloads, that VG found the Norwegian downloaders.","\"Websites that offer child sexual abuse files do it for the money. The downloaders must pay. And when they do, they have to register. This means we can identify them in our logs,\" says VG's data analyst Einar Otto Stangvik.","\"We don't know exactly what each individual has done; we haven't had a camera fixed on them while they downloaded. The only thing we actually know is that a computer at an IP address in the proximity of the man's home has logged on to the file-sharing site with a user name and an e-mail address that suggests that he is the one who did it,\" says Stangvik.","Nonetheless, the information we have has been enough to get several of the ten men VG contacted to admit to having downloaded videos and images of child sexual abuse.","The way in which the videos are stored on the internet is so devious that it takes insight, determination and money to find them. This is what the logs show:","To reach the website where the child sexual abuse files are located, you first have to click on a link on another website. This link takes you to the website where you can download the videos and images.","In other words: the men read about the films, click on a link that takes them to the files, and then download them.","Several of the file names leave no doubt about their content: '5 yo cum in mouth'. 'Baby 6 yo fuck anal'. Others are more cryptic but no less disturbing to read when you know what they contain: 'With my favourite pink teddy bear'; 'Bathtime'.","Other file names are completely anonymous, but websites with file descriptions give more details. For example, that file 'arkivez7.rar' contains 16 films of a mother sexually abusing her three-year-old daughter and 21 films and series of images of extreme child sexual abuse of an American ten-year-old.","The content of another file is described as '10-year-old girls plays with cock'."]}],"video":null,"image":null,"imageGallery":[],"factbox":null,"quote":null,"comment":null,"aside":null,"waypointIndex":2},{"chapterIndex":0,"sectionIndex":7,"id":"the-business-owner","type":"video","isText":false,"paragraphGroups":[],"video":{"vgtv":"118141"},"image":null,"imageGallery":[],"factbox":null,"quote":null,"waypoint":{"slug":"the-business-owner","title":"The business owner"},"comment":null,"aside":null,"waypointIndex":3},{"chapterIndex":0,"sectionIndex":8,"id":"chapter-0-section-8","type":"text","isText":true,"paragraphGroups":[{"paragraphs":["<strong>VG contacts the first man on 16 April.</strong> He is highly educated and runs his own business in a small town in eastern Norway.","Apart from the low humming noise from the photocopier in his dimly-lit office, everything is quiet.

                                                                    <p>Two of them had taken a few drinks to give them Dutch courage before meeting us. One lost several kilos in weight and was unable to sleep after being confronted with what we knew about him. Two have asked for help to stop.</p>
                                                                    <p>Seven of the ten admit to having done what our data suggests: downloaded images and videos showing sexual abuse of children. Three deny everything.</p>

                                                                    <p>And they may be hiding an even darker secret: according to the police and experts, between 30 and 80 per cent of people who download child sexual abuse videos have themselves committed acts of child sexual abuse.</p>
                                                                    <p>If our data is correct, VG knows the identity of up to 60 sex offenders.</p>
                                                                    <p>The chance of any of these men getting caught by the police is minimal. The NCIS (National Criminal Investigation Service) is inundated with new cases.</p>
                                                                    <p>"We've seen a dramatic increase in the number of cases in the space of only a few years. The amount of material confiscated in each case is enormous, often millions of images," says Lena Reif, head of the NCIS Sexual Crimes Unit.</p>
                                                                    <p>Her unit is responsible for investigating downloading and sexual abuse of children. The NCIS continually monitors activities on several file-sharing networks. One day in August last year, the police registered 98 unique Norwegian IP addresses that downloaded or shared child sexual abuse files. In the course of two weeks, the number rose to 1,055 Norwegian IP addresses – and that was only from four file-sharing networks.</p>

                    <p>The men we found live all around the country. We have identified 78 of them, but VG Helg's material contains many more: we have information on a total of 373 Norwegian IP addresses to which sexual abuse files were downloaded.</p>

                                                                    <p>"In 2007 and 2008, considerable resources were allocated to deal with internet-related child sexual abuse. The NCIS was allocated earmarked funds. Since then, resources in this areas have not been strengthened," says Reif.</p>
                                                                    <p>Perhaps this is the reason why most of the downloaders VG has identified have been able to continue downloading without being caught by the police ­– and for a long time. A health care worker has been downloading undisturbed for more than ten years. According to him, he has seen all there is to see of child sexual abuse material.</p>

An American report from 2010 showed that child sexual abuse increased the risk of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress and suicide attempts.</p>
                                                                    <p>"Sexual abuse of children can lead to prolonged and lifelong health problems and increase the risk of suicide attempts and early death," says Siri Thoresen, a senior research at the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies. Thoresen studies the long-term effects of violence and sexual abuse.</p>
                                                                    <p>There are myriads of websites where videos and images like these can be shared. Some of the websites log users and downloads and post them openly online. It was in these logs, containing details of over 36 million downloads, that VG found the Norwegian downloaders.</p>
                                                                    <p>"Websites that offer child sexual abuse files do it for the money. The downloaders must pay. And when they do, they have to register. This means we can identify them in our logs," says VG's data analyst Einar Otto Stangvik.</p>
                                                                    <p>"We don't know exactly what each individual has done; we haven't had a camera fixed on them while they downloaded. The only thing we actually know is that a computer at an IP address in the proximity of the man's home has logged on to the file-sharing site with a user name and an e-mail address that suggests that he is the one who did it," says Stangvik.</p>
                                                                    <p>Nonetheless, the information we have has been enough to get several of the ten men VG contacted to admit to having downloaded videos and images of child sexual abuse.</p>
                                                                    <p>The way in which the videos are stored on the internet is so devious that it takes insight, determination and money to find them. This is what the logs show:</p>
                                                                    <p>To reach the website where the child sexual abuse files are located, you first have to click on a link on another website. This link takes you to the website where you can download the videos and images.</p>
                                                                    <p>In other words: the men read about the films, click on a link that takes them to the files, and then download them.</p>
                                                                    <p>Several of the file names leave no doubt about their content: '5 yo cum in mouth'. 'Baby 6 yo fuck anal'. Others are more cryptic but no less disturbing to read when you know what they contain: 'With my favourite pink teddy bear'; 'Bathtime'.</p>
                                                                    <p>Other file names are completely anonymous, but websites with file descriptions give more details. For example, that file 'arkivez7.rar' contains 16 films of a mother sexually abusing her three-year-old daughter and 21 films and series of images of extreme child sexual abuse of an American ten-year-old.</p>
                                                                    <p>The content of another file is described as '10-year-old girls plays with cock'.</p>

The experts VG has talked to take a different view. Irishman Joe Sullivan is one of Europe's foremost experts in risk assessment of sexual predators:</p>
                                                                    <p>"At some point during the procedural or judicial process, eight out of ten who are convicted once for possession of child sexual abuse material will admit that they have also committed acts of sexual abuse on children. That is my experience from treatment and research," says Sullivan to VG.</p>
                                                                    <p>Sullivan is a forensic psychologist and runs a company called Mentor Forensics. In the past 20 years he has worked on risk assessment for organisations such as the National Crime Agency, the UK equivalent of Norway's National Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS).</p>
                                                                    <p>"The question is not whether or not the downloaders will commit abuse; it is whether they already have, and in what context," he says.</p>
                                                                    <p>When he is asked to find out whether someone who has been convicted for downloading is likely to commit abuse when released, he interviews them using a lie detector.</p>
                                                                    <p>"I do that to confirm that what they tell me is true and not just something they think I want to hear. It's during these interviews that eight out of ten downloaders admit to having committed child sexual abuse before they were charged for possession of child sexual abuse images."</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>"Are there any good reasons for downloading child sexual abuse material?"</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>"None. I'll bet that the men you meet will give you a range of excuses. But the reality is that possessing these films and images shows that they have a sexual interest in children. That means that they represent a risk. The authorities must look at how much contact they've had with children over the years, because there is a strong likelihood that they've already committed abuse," says Sullivan.</p>

The room is called 'Ragnarok', named after the apocalypse in Norse mythology. This is where the investigators conduct their investigations into internet-related child sexual abuse material.</p>

                                                                    <p>"The risk of getting caught needs to be raised. The internet must not be allowed to be a free zone, It's unforgivable if the police don't give these cases priority. These are serious acts. It's about time that the Ministry of Justice be confronted with this, because it's their responsibility."</p>
                                                                    <p>She is frustrated at the authorities' commitment to combat child abuse.</p>
                                                                    <p>"Almost ten years ago, the Ministry of Justice appointed a working group for the prevention of internet-related child sexual abuse. After it submitted a good report in 2007, several measures were followed up, but since then all efforts have just tapered off," says Hegg.</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>"According to the Government's action plan, the efforts to combat the distribution of child sexual abuse images was supposed to be strengthened. What happened?"</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>"The efforts haven't been strengthened. There's no political will to do anything, and there's no system of organising expertise. The NCIS does a lot of good work, but if we're going to step up our efforts, that needs to happen in the police and the support systems. And that hasn't been done so far," says Hegg.</p>
                                                                    <p>She is not the only one to react: exactly two years ago, in September 2013, lawyer Thea Totland wrote a letter alerting the Director of Public Prosecutions to the critical situation in the police force.</p>
                                                                    <p>She wrote: "The treatment provided to children who are subjected to violence and sexual abuse is unworthy of a country governed by the rule of law." She went on to tell of how every week she encountered instances where the Norwegian police failed to take seriously the Director of Public Prosecution's instructions to give priority to violence and sexual offences committed against children.</p>
                                                                    <p>"The Director of Public Prosecutions thought I was dramatising the situation. I can't see that any positive steps have been taken since then. The NCIS has improved its expertise over the years, but they lack the resources. The percentage of child sexual abuse cases that are dropped is close to 80 per cent," she says.</p>
                                                                    <p>The the same year as Totland alerted the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Ministry of Justice signed the Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse, committing Norway to enhancing its efforts to investigate child sexual abuse.</p>
                                                                    <p>However, this commitment has not led to more resources for the investigators in the NCIS.</p>
                                                                    <p>"The NCIS has not received any extra resources to undertake the measures stated in the alliance agreement. And since then the problem has grown dramatically," says Lena Reif.</p>

        <p>Many think that the files are shared on the deep web. They are wrong. Although the file descriptions are stored on the deep web, the actual files are often stored on the open web. The reason for this is simple: the individuals sharing the files want to make money from it.</p>

        <h4>Cash flow</h4>
        <p>The market has multiple direct and indirect players.</p>
        <p>Our focus is on the downloaders. They visit one or more websites on their way to the sexual abuse material. They enter via a forum, follow a link to an advertising service and proceed to a file-sharing website. During these three steps, banner ads and similar advertising is shown, generating traffic which in turn generates cash flows.</p>
        <p>Once they reach the file-sharing website, they often pay money to complete the download.</p>
        <p>A proportion of the money paid to the file-sharing website is often distributed to the individuals who uploaded the files. Sometimes uploaders demand payment in cash for the files, other times they acquire files through barter. Some files contain material they have produced themselves or have acquired free of charge, though not before investing a considerable amount of effort. </p>
        <p>There are often several middlemen between the downloaders and the producers of the material.</p>
        <p>Some producers are financially motivated, others are motivated more by fame, bartering or sexual preferences. In recent years we have seen several examples of filmed sexual abuse to order, particularly in countries like the Philippines and Thailand and other poor regions in Southeast Asia. These may involve the perpetrators' own children, street children or random victims. </p>
        <p>The downloaders have contributed to sustaining an industry by showing their interest and by supplying it with fresh capital. </p>

                        <h2>"New technology presents new challenges."</h2>
                                                    <div class="paragraph-group">
                                                                    <p><strong>Several of the men in VG's material</strong> have been arrested previously in raids on downloaders. Yet they continue to download. One says he does not fear a new investigation.</p>
                                                                    <p>This is the Minister of Justice Anders Anundsen's response to VG's exposé on downloaders:</p>
                                                                    <p>"This shows that there are challenges we need to keep working on. The police must be better able to investigate cases, and preventive measures are also important. Sexual abuse of children is a crime that is given high priority, and this work must be seen in connection with the distribution of child sexual abuse material."</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>"What will you do to ensure that the work the authorities do to combat downloading acts as a deterrent?"</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>"The work on combating sexual exposure and abuse of children and young people online is a priority task that requires extensive cooperation between different actors. New technology has presented the police with challenges in terms of expertise, effective tools and methods."</p>
                                                                    <p>In May the National Police Directorate submitted a report on a cybercrime strategy to the Ministry of Justice, emphasising the need for improved and more specialised expertise and to improve the quality of work and investigative expertise in the police force for dealing with cybercrime. But The NCIS has enhanced its capacity in terms of open and hidden presence online.</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>"The NCIS has not been allocated additional resources to investigate sexual abuse images since 2008. Since then, the number of downloaders has risen dramatically. Save the Children tells VG Helg that the political will to do anything is lacking. Why have the resources not been increased in line with the scope of the problem?"</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>"As previously, six million kroner has been earmarked in 2015 for the NCIS's work on internet-related child sexual abuse. The NCIS is now assessing a new concept that will help the police districts improve their methods for dealing with child sexual abuse material. In addition, the police force has been reinforced with over NOK 1.5 billion over the past two years. This will enable the police to invest even more in priority areas, including the fight against the illegal distribution of images," says Anundsen.</p>

A father of young children comes walking down the street towards us. He does not yet know why he has been asked to talk to VG. He smiles nervously.</p>

The person logged onto a Polish website using this man's user name and e-mail address, and downloaded several videos; videos showing sexual abuse of children – some of them the same age as this man's own children. That morning, a total of 22 files containing child sexual abuse images were downloaded to this man's computer.</p>

VG has not seen the film, but on the deep web it is described as follows: "1-3 years old, violent abuse. Filmed by the dad. In many of the videos you can her screaming or crying, and the dad has to cover her mouth to keep her quiet."</p>

She reacts strongly to hearing that someone who downloads sexual abuse material was approved to run a respite home.</p>
                                                                    <p>"This is completely indefensible. Children who are placed in respite homes must feel sure that they can trust the adults they are visiting," she says.</p>

Aasland considers these men to be an additional risk element for children.</p>
                                                                    <p>"We know that some of those wanting to assault children use sexual abuse videos to show the children that what they will experience is completely natural. In these situations, downloading paves the way for new incidents of abuse."</p>
                                                                    <p>Aasland treats sexual predators, and often receives calls from people telling her they have a need that is growing.</p>
                                                                    <p>"They say they've looked at sexual abuse images for many years and that they now feel that looking at them is no longer enough. They're worried that they might commit sexual offences themselves. And if you work with children, the likelihood of that happening can be very high."</p>
                                                                    <p>Aasland's assessment tallies with how the police determine which cases to focus on, says Lena Reif, head of the Sexual Crimes Unit and the NCIS:</p>
                                                                    <p>"High priority is given to men who are at risk of committing physical abuse. Having access to children or having positions involving sports, music or those kinds of activities are criteria that often make cases a priority," she says.</p>
                                                                    <p>In VG's log data, we find one man who was arrested some years ago in a large-scale police raid and was convicted for having paid over NOK 100,000 for child sexual abuse images.</p>
                                                                    <p>Reif is not surprised to hear that convicted men continue to download.</p>
                                                                    <p>"That tallies with our understanding of both sexual predators and those who download child sexual abuse material. Some are probably scared off for shorter or longer periods, but most of them will continue."</p>
                                                                    <p><strong>"So it doesn't help to catch them?"</strong></p>

VG has also spoken with her psychologist, who says that the damage she suffered is what can be expected after extreme and prolonged abuse. "If a person was standing five metres from a bomb that went off, she would sustain injuries commensurate with that event. The same applies in cases of abuse. In 'Aurora's' case, the injuries are pronounced and severe," says the therapist.

                                                                    <p>"They say that ordering abuse of children is a new thing. It's not new at all. That's what happened to me. If no one had wanted to see and pay for these assaults, I wouldn't have gone through what I did," she says quietly.</p>
                                                                    <p>'Aurora' says that growing up in the 1980s, her childhood consisted of systematic, monthly abuse that was perpetrated because someone had asked for it. She has kept this secret for most of her life. Now she wants to speak out, even though her head and body protest.</p>
                                                                    <p>From the age of six, she stayed many weekends each month with friends of her parents. The man of the house would take her to a basement where a photographer and sometimes other men were waiting.</p>
                                                                    <p>"First I would have to drink a cup of tea with a mixture in it. I tried not to drink it, because it made me lose control of my body. But I usually ended up having to do it because I couldn't stop crying. Then they did whatever they wanted to do to me before looking through the pictures. Then they drove me back," she says.</p>
                                                                    <p>'Aurora' tells of the moment when she realised that someone had paid to watch her being abused.</p>
                                                                    <p>"I was wearing a red silk nightdress that was a bit too big for me. It had thin straps."</p>
                                                                    <p>The men around her were having a discussion. The customer had asked for a specific skin colour, and that the child should look into the camera and smile.</p>
                                                                    <p>"But I couldn't do it. I was so doped up that I barely managed to hold my head up. And the straps on the nightdress kept slipping down. Then there was a lot of commotion. That was the first time I heard them talking about it.</p>

        <h2>How we found the downloaders</h2>
        <p>It was VG's data analyst Einar Otto Stangvik who uncovered and analysed the data logs that provided us with the identities of Norwegians believed to have downloaded child sexual abuse material. It has been a demanding task, but it shows that downloaders are not as invisible as they thought they were. This is what Stangvik did:</p>

        <h4>36 MILLION DOWNLOADS</h4>
        <p>While working on another story, VG Helg became aware of the existence of websites all over the world which we suspected contained sexual abuse material. On further investigation it became clear that a certain type of file-sharing service was often used to distribute these files. We also discovered that many of these sites stored logs showing who had downloaded which files. On some sites these logs were openly accessible, and we began systematically downloading them.</p>
        <p>VG Helg is now in possession of 36 million lines of data containing details such as time of download, file name, linking sites, IP address, user name, and e-mail address.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-custom-5">
        <img class="" src="./The Downloaders_files/metode2.png" alt="Steg 2">
        <h4>THE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE FILES</h4>
        <p>Not all the 36 million downloads contain child sexual abuse material. To find out which files showed sexual abuse of children, we used the information obtained from both the open and the deep web to find the names of the files with this content. We gradually accumulated a small group of file names, which we then used to find even more. Our theory was that those who downloaded the files we knew about would also download other files.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-custom-5">
        <img class="" src="./The Downloaders_files/metode3.png" alt="Steg 3">
        <h4>THE NORWEGIAN USERS</h4>

        <p>Starting off with the 36 million downloads and the files we knew contained child sexual abuse material, we developed a system which gradually identified related files and then excluded files which we were fairly sure did not contain child sexual abuse material.</p>

        <p>The first step in the search system identified who had downloaded the first files we knew contained videos showing sexual abuse of children</p>.

        <p>In the next step the search system filtered out the downloads that were not made from IP addresses in Norway or that originated in known proxy services etc. This left us with 550 Norwegian downloads of the initial files.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-custom-5">
        <img class="" src="./The Downloaders_files/metode4.png" alt="Steg 4">
        <h4>EXPANDED THE SEARCH</h4>
        <p>For each of the 550 downloads we had information on the IP address, file name, download time, the downloader's e-mail address and user name, and which websites they had come from (so-called referrers). We then proceeded to:</p>
        <ul class="no-padding-list">
         <li>Retrieve every download that was made to the same IP addresses as each of the 550 files.</li>
         <li>Retrieve every download that was made at the same time as each of the 550 files were downloaded.</li>
         <li>Retrieve every download that was made to the same user name. </li>
         <li>Retrieve every download that was made to the same e-mail address. </li>
         <li>Retrieve every download that was made by users who had come from the same referrer as each of the 550 files. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This process resulted in a large number of downloads which we then sorted by limiting our search to downloads made from Norway. Several other filters were also activated to ensure that the downloads we obtained contained child sexual abuse material. </p>
        <p>We then ended up with around 6,000 downloads of child sexual abuse material made from Norway. Several of the link sites to the downloads were also checked, and several files were assessed by the National Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) to verify or dispel our suspicions regarding their content. This manual task required more filters, which were incorporated during the process. Once these were in place, we ended up with around 5,500 downloads made from Norway. </p>

        <img class="" src="./The Downloaders_files/metode5.png" alt="Steg 5">
        <h4>Identity</h4>
        <p>This analysis provided us with a list of user names and e-mail addresses that originated from Norwegian IP addresses. We sorted these according to number of downloads and then proceeded to investigate these individuals one by one, starting with those who had made the most downloads. </p>
        <p>We tried to identify each individual using user names, e-mail addresses and other details registered in social media and search systems. We also managed to track down some of them via Skype and Twitter, and many via Facebook. In most cases, and particularly in the case of the individuals we chose to contact, we could verify connections between the user names, e-mail addresses and IP addresses in the logs and their actual identity using more than method. </p>

                    <h3>What do we really know?</h3>
                    <p>VG must take into account that the downloads may have been made by someone other than the men we have identified. The only thing we strictly do know is that a computer on an IP address where the man lives, have used a user name associated with this man's e-mail address to log on one or more file sharing sites - and then download abusive images and sexualized images of children. We have had contact with ten men we have identified. Seven of them admit that our information matches what they have actually done.</p>

The e-mail account contained a Norwegian man's name, which in turn led us to a Norwegian company. On that company's website we found a man's name whose date of birth matched the numbers in the downloader's user name. We eventually tracked down his e-mail address on two other websites, one of which was for a religious organisation In our story the man is presented as a youth leader.</p>

Even though they watch child sexual abuse videos, they could never commit sexual abuse themselves.</p>
                                                                    <p>Sexologist Margrete Wiede Aasland has many years of experience in treating sexual predators. She is not convinced by the explanations the men gave to VG.</p>
                                                                    <p>"If it doesn't turn them on, they why do the download it? Sexual predators are known for making excuses and playing down what they do. Perhaps they believe it themselves. Many need to live under some kind of illusion in order to continue downloading."</p>
                                                                    <p>Like Joe Sullivan, the Irish expert on child sexual abuse, she also sees a connection between downloading and committing physical abuse. She nods affirmatively when she hears Sullivan's finding that eight out of ten downloaders also commit physical abuse of children.</p>
                                                                    <p>"That does not surprise me. It's not uncommon for people undergoing treatment here to admit more and more."</p>

                                                                    <p>"Even though they do not commit physical abuse offences, downloaders are party to sustaining an industry. The money they pay makes it lucrative to commit new abuses," says Aasland.</p>

They do this not to make it easier for each other, but to earn money from like-minded people.

                                                                    <p>"And to do that, they have to register. This means we can identify them in our logs," says VG's data analyst Einar Otto Stangvik.</p>

If they download over several years – as many of them have – the amounts can quickly add up. One downloader who continues to download has previously been convicted for having paid NOK 100,000 for sexual abuse videos. Based on this information and the data on the number of users, teasers, and subscription fees, it is easy to see that these websites are raking in millions of kroner annually.</p>

Yves Goethals, head of the Child Pornography Unit in the Belgian police, says that it is difficult to investigate the owner: "The law is clear: the administrator is not responsible for files which others have stored on his service. That is as long as he is not aware of the content. And if he does know, it's very difficult for us to prove that," says Geothals.

                        <h5>Editor of VG:</h5>
                        <h2>Why we used these methods</h2>
                                                    <div class="paragraph-group">
                                                                    <p><strong>Dear reader</strong> This story is based on extraordinary journalistic methods. It is extremely rare for VG to use hidden audio and video recordings when we meet interview objects, but in these instances it was the only way to document that Norwegian family men, health care worker, and well-educated men in business and industry admit to having downloaded extreme and in some cases violent sexual abuse material. Through the use of authentic recordings we have also been able to document how these men explain their actions.</p>
                                                                    <p>In this connection we refer to clause 3.10 of the Ethical Code of Practice, which permits the use of hidden cameras and microphones when this "is the only possible way to uncover cases of essential importance to society." We consider the fact that Norwegian men are helping to finance sexual abuse that damages and destroys children's lives by their downloading to be a crystal-clear case of such importance.</p>
                                                                    <p>The men we contacted were selected on the basis of the amount and type of sexual abuse material they have downloaded. Our investigations into some of them were abandoned when circumstances made it difficult to contact them.</p>
                                                                    <p>We wanted to talk to the men about the information in our possession without their families or others close to them finding out, so as to protect the privacy and anonymity of both the men and their families.</p>
                                                                    <p>We also wanted to be present to observe the men's reactions when there were confronted with the documentation VG had obtained. We therefore provided few details about the content of the story in telephone conversations during which meetings were arranged.</p>
                                                                    <p>We adopted no hidden agenda or identity in the course of our research for this story. The men knew that they were meeting journalists from VG and that the findings would be published in VG.</p>
